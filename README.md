PokeApp – Osvaldo Sanchez
Purpose: This app was built as a final term project for my Mobile Development class while in college.  
This app is built to assign a user six random creatures form the Pokémon universe as friends.  
It does this through an asynchronous task that creates a URL and retrieves the name, picture, and types of the assigned Pokémon. 
Those are then saved to a database so that the user can see all of their friends!  
Developed in android studio using Java.  Running screenshots are attached.
